# **Fashion Recommender System** 🛍️  

This project is a **Fashion Recommender System** that suggests visually similar fashion items based on an uploaded image. It utilizes a **pre-trained ResNet50 model** for feature extraction and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for finding the most similar items. The web interface is built using **Streamlit**, providing a user-friendly experience.
